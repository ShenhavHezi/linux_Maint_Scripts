# 📄 disk_monitor.sh — Linux Disk Usage Monitoring Script <a name="disk_monitorsh--linux-disk-usage-monitoring-script"></a>

## 🔹 Overview
`disk_monitor.sh` is a **Bash script** designed to monitor disk usage on one or more Linux servers.  
It checks all mounted filesystems and generates alerts if usage exceeds a defined threshold.  

The script can run in two modes:
- **Local mode** → monitor the server it’s running on.  
- **Distributed mode** → monitor multiple servers remotely via SSH from a central master server.  

This makes it useful both for personal Linux machines and production environments.

---

## 🔹 Features
- ✅ Configurable disk usage **threshold** (default: 90%)  
- ✅ Checks **all filesystems** (ignores `tmpfs` and `devtmpfs`)  
- ✅ Supports **multiple servers** using an external `servers.txt`  
- ✅ Sends alerts to **multiple recipients** defined in `emails.txt` or as a string  
- ✅ Logs all results (OK + ALERT) to `/var/log/disks_monitor.log`  
- ✅ Works unattended via `cron` scheduling  
- ✅ Clean design: configuration files in `/etc/linux_maint/`  

---

## 🔹 File Locations
/usr/local/bin/disk_monitor.sh
- Configuration files:  
  /etc/linux_maint/servers.txt   # list of servers  
  /etc/linux_maint/emails.txt    # list of email recipients
- Log file:  
/var/log/disks_monitor.log

---

## 🔹 Configuration

### 1. Disk usage threshold
THRESHOLD=90
Modify this value if you want a different threshold (e.g., 80%).

### 2. Server list
📌 /etc/linux_maint/servers.txt
One server per line (hostname or IP).
Example:
By convention:  
- Script itself: 
server1
server2
server3
If you don’t want a file, you can write directly in the script:
SERVERLIST="server1.example.com,server2.example.com"

### 3. Email recipients

📌 /etc/linux_maint/emails.txt
One email per line.
Example:
alice@example.com
bob@example.com

If you don’t want a file, you can write directly in the script:
ALERT_EMAIL="alice@example.com,bob@example.com"

### 🔹 Usage
Run manually
bash /usr/local/bin/disk_monitor.sh

Run daily via cron
Edit crontab:
crontab -e
Add line to run every day at 8:00 AM:
0 8 * * * /usr/local/bin/disk_monitor.sh

# 📄 health_monitor.sh — Linux Health Check Script <a name="health_monitorsh--linux-health-monitoring-script"></a>

## 🔹 Overview
`health_monitor.sh` is a **Bash script** designed to monitor the overall health of one or more Linux servers.  
It collects CPU, memory, load average, and disk usage, then generates a daily report.  

The script can run in two modes:
- **Local mode** → monitor the server it’s running on.  
- **Distributed mode** → monitor multiple servers remotely via SSH from a central master server.  

This makes it suitable for both personal Linux machines and production environments.

---

## 🔹 Features
- ✅ Monitors **CPU load**, **memory usage**, and **disk usage**  
- ✅ Supports **multiple servers** using an external `servers.txt`  
- ✅ Skips servers listed in `excluded.txt`  
- ✅ Logs all results to `/var/log/health_monitor.log`  
- ✅ Emails the report to multiple recipients listed in `emails.txt`  
- ✅ Works unattended via `cron` scheduling  
- ✅ Clean design: configuration files in `/etc/linux_maint/`

## 🔹 File Locations
By convention:  
- Script itself:  
/usr/local/bin/health_monitor.sh

- Configuration files:  
 /etc/linux_maint/servers.txt # list of servers
 /etc/linux_maint/excluded.txt # list of excluded servers
 /etc/linux_maint/emails.txt # list of email recipients
- Log file:
  /var/log/health_monitor.log

## 🔹 Configuration

### 1. Server list

### 2. Excluded servers
📌 `/etc/linux_maint/excluded.txt`  
One server per line. Servers here will be skipped during health checks.  
Example:
server2

### 3. Email recipients
📌 `/etc/linux_maint/emails.txt`  
One email per line.  
Example:
bob@example.com
alice2@example.com

# 📄 user_monitor.sh — Linux User & Access Monitoring Script <a name="user_monitorsh--linux-user--access-monitoring-script"></a>

## 🔹 Overview
`user_monitor.sh` is a **Bash script** designed to monitor user accounts and SSH access activity across one or more Linux servers.  
It detects new or removed system users, changes in sudo privileges, and failed SSH login attempts.  

The script can run in two modes:
- **Local mode** → monitor the server it’s running on.  
- **Distributed mode** → monitor multiple servers remotely via SSH from a central master server.  

This makes it suitable for both security auditing and operational monitoring in production environments.

---

## 🔹 Features
- ✅ Detects **newly added or removed system users** (compared to baseline)  
- ✅ Monitors for **changes in sudoers configuration**  
- ✅ Reports **failed SSH login attempts in the last 24h**  
- ✅ Supports **multiple servers** using an external `servers.txt`  
- ✅ Logs all results to `/var/log/user_monitor.log`  
- ✅ Optional email alerts to recipients in `emails.txt`  
- ✅ Works unattended via `cron` scheduling  
- ✅ Clean design: configuration files in `/etc/linux_maint/`
